# Personal Website Portfolio

This is my personal website/portfolio. It has been customized and adapted starting from the original DevPortfolio by Ryan Fitzgerald. Credit and thanks to the author for the great starting point.

- Original template: https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio

## Tech
- Astro (static site generator)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Run locally

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+

```
git clone https://github.com/gennscar/gennscar.github.io.git
cd gennscar.github.io
npm install
npm run dev
```

Astro will print a local URL (e.g. http://localhost:4321 or similar).
